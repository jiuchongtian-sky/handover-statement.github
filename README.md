I need to get one for a friend's company handover statement app
This will be processed in the form of a ledger 
His employees, the handover needs to take pictures of the code table, and I need the app to directly identify the code table numbers and fill in the form for translation. 
I'm just trying to figure out how to get here, from start to finish,
