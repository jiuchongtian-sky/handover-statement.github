I need to get one for a friend's company handover statement app

This will be processed in the form of a ledger 

His employees, the handover needs to take pictures of the code table, and I need the app to directly identify the code table numbers and fill in the form for translation.

I'm just trying to figure out how to get here, from start to finish, 

# The first step needs to establish a form, the form needs to establish a photo storage function, 

# The second step to establish a database, and then carry out photo identification data collection into the database, classify the pre-code table, is the entry, post-code table, is the account. In needs to subdue out to equal the data.

# Step 3 needs to put the all total

# The fourth step needs to establish a guest database and form, requiring employees to manually add guest data, guest data, and then automatically accumulated by the system

# the five The fifth step is SUN = total plus the remaining data of the previous shift to sum the total data,

# the sixth step is to establish the data in the database, and all the data are concluded every month.
